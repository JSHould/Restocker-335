## Restocker TBC 2022.2.2

- `[Bug]` Fixing reverse bag iteration to prefer latest items over oldest

## Restocker TBC 2022.2.1

- `[Bug]` Accidentally introduced dependency on Questie, now fixed.

## Restocker TBC 2022.1.1

- Rogue poisons ingredients for classic were wrong from the Wowhead guide. Now updated to the
  correct ingredients.
- When stashing to bank, iterate bags in reverse orders, so that newest bagged items would be moved
  first, and not leave gaps in your bag.

## Restocker TBC 2022.1.0

- Restocking algorithm fixed. Now will always prefer to move smaller stacks before bigger stacks.
  This is still imperfect but should not leave small stacks behind, at least not many of those.

## Restocker TBC 2021.10.1

- Interval between bank clicks is now calculated based on ping to server (ping x3 but no faster than
  140 ms which is 7 times per second).

## Restocker TBC 2021.9.2

- A new editbox added to require vendor NPC reaction (neutral, friendly, honored or exalted) to
  restock each item. Empty value does not check the vendor reaction, number 4 requires neutral
  faction, 5 - friendly, 6 - honored, 7 - revered and 8 requires exalted standing with the vendor.

## Restocker TBC 2021.9.1

- UI version update for TBC Phase 2
- Fix: Bank restocking goes one item at a time, not multiple items in parallel
- Fix: Bank restocking will retry moving if a slot is locked (due to being moved at this time or
  other reasons), and will not attempt to move from other bag slots

## Restocker TBC 2021.8.2-3

- Fix: Bank restocking only does 1 pass and stops, allowing you to use bank normally.
- Fix: Bank restocking in and out will check the bag space before operations. Requires 1 free slot
  in both bank and character bag.
- Small fix to first move small stacks before splitting large
-

## Restocker TBC 2021.8.1

- Bank restocking bug fixed. Requires 1 free player bag slot to move into split bank stacks.
  Requires 1 free bank slot to move into split player bag stacks. Full stacks can be moved without
  splitting and no extra bag slot is required. For example: Moving 1 item into stack of 19 requires
  a free extra bag slot.

## Restocker TBC 2021.6.1

- Updated bank bag count for TBC, fixed restocking from bank bug

## Restocker TBC 2021.5.3

- Support for multiple languages, now rogue poisons and restocking in general will work in any
  language.

## Restocker TBC 2021.5.2

- TBC: Rogue poisons have became cheaper, reagent cost update

## Restocker TBC 2021.5.0-1

- Initial import of code and UI version bump.

## 6.2

- Now restocks items with random suffixes
- Now restocks items as soon as you press enter when changing restocking number on the main window
  while bank is open
- Reduced chat-spam when changing profiles at the bank.

## 6.1

- Added login message setting

## 6.0

- Fixed the "Restock from bank" checkbox resetting each time the addon loaded
- New experimental banking operation (should be way faster).

## 5.12

- Holding shift will now prevent the addon from doing its thing when opening bank/merchant
- Now buys the right amount of reagents based on if you have any in your bags or not

## 5.11

- Fixed addon continuing to grab stuff from bags / bank when there are no empty slots, will now stop
  when error comes up saying bags or bank is full.

## 5.10

- Fixed a bug when switching profiles while merchant window was open causing the addon to sell all
  items set to 0.

## 5.9

- Now allows shiftclicking and dragging items into textfield.

## 5.8

- Housekeeping and hopefully some improvements where the addon wasn't buying everything the first
  time you talked to a vendor.
    - This could also be because of how the game handles getting item info and if the item isn't
      cached then you have to wait for the server to send the data.

## 5.7

- Updated event driven restocking from bank to a OnUpdate script.

## 5.6.4

- Updated the logic regarding poisons and minimum supply.
    - Now checks if you have poisons in the bank, if you don't it will buy the needed amount of
      reagents every time to get to the cap.
    - If you do have poisons in the bank then it will only buy poison reagents if you are below 50%
      of your set amount (up to the cap).
    - By far the easiest thing to do in regards to this is to just craft a lot of poisons and store
      them in your bank and making a habit of visiting the bank to restock on already crafted
      poisons.
    - The change was made to make it easier for rogues still leveling to use this to restock on
      poison supplies when they visit a vendor but perhaps only missing ~30% of them.

- Removed the delay between opening 2 merchant windows. This was put in place to prevent the addon
  from buying basically double the amount of reagents because you closed the window to fast and
  reopened it. Inadvertantly it made automatic restocking from multiple vendors take longer so it's
  now been removed.

- Added a "Restocker finished restocking from vendor." message to indicate that you can now close
  the merchant window.
- Added a "Restocker finished restocking from bank." message.

## 5.6.3

    - What this basically accomplishes is better order in the bankframe where items get grabbed from
      the back first.
